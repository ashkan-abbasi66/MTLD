This matlab package implements and demonstrates the image denoising algorithm presented in

J. Sulam, B. Ophir, and M. Elad, "Image Denoising Through Multi-Scale Learnt Dictionaries", 
ICIP, Paris, October 27-30, 2014.



Two example images are provided: the traditional picture Lena, and an image taken from the 
NOAA image dataset, 
which is considerable larger - so computation time is longer - where texture artifacts are more noticeable.

Note that K-SVD and OMP matlab packages are needed, and can be downloaded from
